### Greetings
Well, hello there stranger. You have reached my profile page in GitHub. I go by the name of `silemi5` when I'm on my workstation 😎.

### What do I do?
I chose the path of being a back-end web developer ever since my second year in college. Full-stack never really stuck to me, since partly front-end are my bane in crafting applications.

### Technologies? Frameworks?
Everything is different. I've tried many platforms but fell in love with web technologies. Formerly a PHP artisan (😉), now primarily wielding TypeScript in NodeJS and MongoDB. I like the concept of containers, so it doesn't come to surprise that I also like to use Docker though. Also a little familiar with Kubenetes, enought to deploy our project locally. Redis also count somewhat (yey caching). Oh, and a little security principles.  

#### TL;DR:  
- ✅ TypeScript  
- ✅ NodeJS  
- ✅ MongoDB  
- ✅ Docker  
- ✅ Redis  
- ✅ Kubenetes

### So, why silemi5?
Combination of `silence` and `emir`, with `5` as my favorite number.  
It was actually materialized when we had an activity in college to name yourself (?), and that's the first thing I thought of. They thought I was annoyed by their noise when it was my turn to introduce myself 😂

### Tips?
Try to write once in a while. Really.  
Fun fact: this `README.md` was a challenge to myself. I like to have my own spin to this `README.md`, instead of just enumerating 😆.

### Projects?
Look around in my [repositories](https://github.com/silemi5?tab=repositories). It may be updated once in a while, but I have no guarantees 😉.

### Anything else
Are you still here? I like your commitments to reading my `README` fully 🙂. Maybe I start a small blog. Just maybe.
