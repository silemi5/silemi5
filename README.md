### Greetings
Well, hello there stranger. You have reached my profile page in GitHub. I go by the name of `silemi5` when I'm on my workstation.

### What do I do?
I chose the path of being a back-end web developer ever since my second year in college. Full-stack never really stuck to me, since partly front-end are my bane in crafting applications.

### Technologies? Frameworks?
Everything is different. I've tried many platforms but fell in love with web technologies. Formerly a PHP artisan, now primarily wielding TypeScript in NodeJS and MongoDB. I like the concept of containers, so it doesn't come to surprise that I also like to use Docker though. Also somewhat familiar with Kubernetes, enough to deploy our project locally.

#### TL;DR:  
- ✅ TypeScript  
- ✅ NodeJS  
- ✅ MongoDB  
- ✅ Docker
- ✅ Kubernetes

Look around in my [repositories](https://github.com/silemi5?tab=repositories). It may be updated once in a while, but I have no guarantees.

### So, why silemi5?
Combination of `silence` and `emir`, with `5` as my favorite number.  
It was actually materialized when we had an activity in college to name yourself (?), and that's the first thing I thought of. They thought I was annoyed by their noise when it was my turn to introduce myself.


### Bonus section
Nice! You are actually checking my `README` file. Here, have a cookie 🍪.
